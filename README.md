# Machine-Learning-Projects
Data Analytics and Machine Learning Projects I created with public data

My interpretation of datasets. The following packages were used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

As of March 2022 I am new to data science and machine learning. To help practice I decided to analyze and create machine learning estimators (models) for public datasets.

The steps I take within my projects are as follows:
  Problem Definition
  Data Description
  Evaulation of Project
  Features Data and Engineering
  Visualizing Data
  Modeling
  Conclusion
